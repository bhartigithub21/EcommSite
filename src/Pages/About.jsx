				Have you ever been peckish at the grocery store, tried a free sample,
				and left with a two-month supply of cookies? Or bought custom shampoo
				because an Instagram ad captured your hair care journey to a T? If so,

				to drive sales and build lasting brand loyalty—all good things for a
				growing business. Reference:
